subtitle: Your digital will for cryptocurrencies
---

In this developing world of Blockchain, we are identified as our keys which is amazing, but...

- What if life takes a turn?
- What if you forget your private key and seed phrase?
- What if there is a fire and your computer which stored the keys dies?
- What if in an accident you suffer amnesia? Or worst case: what if you face a sudden demise?

CryptoWill provides a decentralized alternative to a traditional "will" and also solves the problem of dormant Cryptocurrencies!

It lets users store their cryptocurrencies in a decentralized "will", so as to prevent their holdings from becoming dormant in case of loss of private keys or user demise.

I worked on this project during my Tezos India Fellowship, along with my teammate [Udit Kapoor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/udit-kapoor-192767191/). I contributed to the front-end of the application by developing the React app with Typescript, and then integrating it with the SmartPy endpoints and contract storage with the Taquito.js Javascript library.

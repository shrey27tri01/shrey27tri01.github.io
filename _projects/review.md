**reviewyourreads** is a book review website, where you can have access to the details of many books, including the information from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/), a popular book review website.  
You can also add reviews to the books and can read the reviews which others have left. But one user cannot add multiple reviews to the same book.  

Also, you can make api reqests to the server to the ```/api/<isbn>``` route, which will return a json object with the details of the book.

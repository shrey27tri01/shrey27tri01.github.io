Our theory as well as implementation project reports for the CS202 Design and Analysis of Algorithms course

#### The theory project:

Given a tree T, we had to give an algorithm that either correctly computes a dominating set for T such that every vertex in T has exactly one vertex from the dominating set in its open neighbourhood (The open neighbourhood of a vertex contains all its neighbours) or decides that such a dominating set does not exist.

#### The implementation project:

Every number is multiplication of some prime numbers. A prime number is a number which is only
divided by `1` and itself. Here, we are given a number `n`. We have to find the prime numbers whose
multiplication makes this number.

#### Implementation:
